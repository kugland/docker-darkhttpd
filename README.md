This image uses [`darkhttpd`](https://unix4lyfe.org/darkhttpd/) to serve static files. This image
is built `FROM scratch` and the `darkhttpd` binary is statically linked, so as to make the image
very small. To use it, just mount your files (preferentially in read-only mode) into `/www` and,
if you like, expose port 80.
